# Weed-Species-Classification-using-Deep-Learning-and-Explainable-AI-XAI-
This project focuses on building a robust deep learning model to classify various weed species from the DeepWeed dataset. The model not only achieves high accuracy but also incorporates explainability through Grad-CAM heatmaps to visually interpret model predictions.
